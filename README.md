Project1:

TWITTER SENTIMENT ANALYSIS:

The Project Deals with analysis of sentiments of tweets on social media website called Twitter.The dataset is labelled with tweets annonated with the sentiment (0 =negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive).

Workflow of the project:

1.Converting csv file to dataframe using pandas

2.Checking for missing values

3.Remove the stop words of the tweet

4.Building a Classification model(classifier used in the model is Decision tree classifier) with polarity as target variable.

5.Evaluvate the model by Evaluvation metrics such as precision,recall,f1score,accuracy and auc/roc curve

Conclusion:
Through this project,One can predict the polarity of tweets

Project2:

RATINGS OF GUVI COURSES

The project Deals about Guvi Courses. The dataset for this project is labelled dataset andcontains informationabout Guvi courses in various categories, including course title, URL, price, number of
subscribers, number of reviews, number of lectures, course level, rating, content duration,published timestamp, and subject. With this dataset, we can track the performance of courses
and uncover opportunities to generate revenue.The project delays with predicting the rating of given  courses

Workflow of Project:

1.Handling the missing values

2.Converting categorical variables into numerical variables using one-hot encoding and label encoding

3.Buid a regression model (model used in the project is multiple linear regression model) with ratings a targett variable

4.Evaluvate the model using rsquare error

Conclusion:Through this project one can predict the ratings of courses

Project3:

INSTAGRAM INFLUENCERS:


Answer the following questions based on the given data set:
1. Are there any correlated features in the given dataset? If yes, state the correlation
coefficient of the pair of features which are highly correlated.
2. What is the frequency distribution of the following features?
○ Influence Score
○ Followers
○ Posts

3. Which country houses the highest number of Instagram Influencers? Please show the
count of Instagram influencers in different countries using barchart.
4. Who are the top 10 influencers in the given dataset based on the following features
● Followers
● Average likes
● Total Likes
5. Describe the relationship between the following pairs of features using a suitable graph
● Followers and Total Likes
● Followers and Influence Score
● Posts and Average likes
● Posts and Influence Score


Project 4:

IMAGE CLASSIFICATION:

Image classification refers to grouping the images based on similar features. It is a supervised learning approach.This particualar project to perform a binary classification of the given images. The binary classes identified are cats and dogs. 

Workflow of the projects:

1.Extracting the features

2.The feature we are considering here is the mean of the rgb pixels.Hence we have 3 features

3.Build a classification model to classify  the image is dog or cat.

4.Trying with different classification model and Evaluvate the model with evaluvation metrics such as confusion matrix ,recall ,precision, f1 score and accuracy


Conclusion:
Through this project One can classify dog vs cat
